// Queue circular buffer (replaces 'Fifo' - doesn't have common interrupt blocking)
// Dan Jackson, 2016


// A circular queue of fixed-size elements. 
// This implementation tracks the head and tail indexes (leaving the length to be derived),
// rather than choose to track the head (or tail) and the length (leaving the other 
// end to be derived).  To avoid the full/empty ambiguity when the head and tail are the 
// same index, the maximum number of elements is 'capacity'-1.  However, the advantage 
// of this approach is that many producer/consumer applications (even those that 
// run in different embedded contexts) may not require a mutex as the length is never 
// directly written, and neither the head nor tail are derived from the other end.
